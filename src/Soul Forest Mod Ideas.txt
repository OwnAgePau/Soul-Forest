Gem Powers:
	Active:
// Right clicking uses
// Teleportation
- Aquamarine: Water - (Amulet of Water, an amount of uses to travel across water (teleportation perhaps))

// Transmuting
- Citrine: Wealth - (Amulet of Wealth, convert things to be more usefull) Perhaps make a cool block where you can combine citrine with other gems to convert them.

// Healing/Curing
- Amazonite: Healing - (Amulet of Healing, an amount of uses to fully heal yourself)
- Lila: Healing - (same as amazonite, let there be more ways to craft the same amulet)
- Amethyst: Cure Poison/Prevent poison - (Amulet of Poison, an mount of uses to cure from poison, or an amount of uses to prevent yourself from being poisoned)

// Buffs, potioneffects
- Jade: Blessing - (Amulet of Blessing, it gives you a small buff when used)
- Topaz: Blessing - (Amulet of Blessing, same as jade)
- Onyx: Invisibility - (Amulet of Invisibility, go invisible for a few seconds)
- Opal: Invisibility - (Use this together with onxy to create the amulet)
- Violet: Regeneration - (Amulet of Regeneration, use this to gain a regeneration buff)

// Uses other then right clicking
- Scarletite: Enchanting - (Amulet of Enchanting, use this to enchant weapons with "random" enchantments) Extra block?
- Jet: Reparation - (Amulet of Reparation, use the amulet to repar tools/armor) Perhaps make a cool block where you can repair the tools using the amulet.
	
	Passive (Amulet Rings):

- Olivine: Protection - (Amulet of Protection, protecting from incoming damage) - Peridot Amulet
- Turquoise: Protection - (Amulet of Protection, same as olivine)

- Change titanium to no longer be a gem, it can only be melted using lava. (perhaps remove?)
- Perhaps let the Olivine be Peridot instead as Olivine is the mineral in which peridot exists.

Ideas:
- A Green/blue temple in the peat bog biome (with rooftop)
- Think Traps & Fire when it comes to structures.
- Use Custom blocks near the Enchanting, Wealth and Reapir tables to increase the outcome.
- Make it possible to create your own amulets (needing items for the strength of the effect, items for the effect and items for the ring/stone itself)
- Potion effects being added from different altars making them usefull to fight bosses at.
- If i move the frozen stuff out to a new dimension, add a white fog colour and where you can only see close. Also see if i can add snow falling. (frozen could be a sky dimension)
- Add a use for fireblossems and cantaloupe
- Upside down trees
- Double JUMP
- Paintings with soul wooden frames (or even hardwood)
- Mobs with "area damage" that effect you when getting closer to an enemy (like a fire mob that sets mobs that come close on fire).
- Use certain gems to teleport (or magical shards) advanced uses it like a enderpearl but different, certain other effects on teleportation or use of shards
- An enemy that fights most other mobs and can level up
- Some less gems perhaps
- Armor set bonuses (more, different) and or abilities, item abilities
- Use different materials like redstone, glowstone, sugar or whatever to create magical stuff
- Have gem dust (or something else magical) instead of blocks to use in recipes for magical fragments
- Sword enchantment that applies a potion effect on enemies
- Potion effect that randomly spawns creatures (like for the Ice Queen spawning Ice Fairy's)
- Potion effect that allows the player to walk through lava/water)

- Sub Mod: Ranking Tier system thingy
- Sub Mod: Underground biomes, biome changing items (change biome type)
